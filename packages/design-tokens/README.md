# Design Tokens

[![API stability](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-experimental-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#documentation_stability_index)

Design tokens are the atomic entities of our design language. They are named key/value pairs that store visual design attributes and export them in convenient file formats, which are ready for integration into your apps and websites.

We recommend using design tokens in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values, font sizes, etc..) in order to centralise your design language and enforce UI consistency.

Design tokens are currently exported in the following formats: `js`, `json`.
